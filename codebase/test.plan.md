Project test plan:

Feature testing:
- Timestep: 		
  For one day per tick case and 1000 day per tick case.
  Condition: the device running must be able to handle 60 tick per second. 
  Desired result: The timestep should not be interfering with the formular, and increase the velocity of the planets in the simulation in any situation.
 
- Formular: 
  Test if the planets will move closer to the sun the longer the simulation runs
  Condition: the device running must be able to handle 60 tick per second. 
  Desired result: the planets should be moving closer to the sun while moving around the sun to show that the gravity formular is working accordingly.

- Background: 
  Test if the background goes in front of the planets.
  The test cases will be tested in different tick per second.
  Desired result: The bakground should be covered by the planets at all time.
