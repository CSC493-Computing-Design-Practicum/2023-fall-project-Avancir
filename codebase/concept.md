## Concept Proposal

	concept.md
  - Project Name: Gravity
  - Goals: create a useful tool to demonstrate the effects of gravity, including the relation between objects on Earth, and relation 
	       between Earth and other planets
  - Context: Berea College CSC493 coding capstone project.
  - Novelty: demonstrate through coding algorithm
  - Functionality: Will be able to apply gravity on every objects created by the constructor. 	               Will be able to create various objects of different types to demonsstrate the features of the algorithm.
  - Audience: Collegemates, Professors, Companies. 
  - Challenges: Might be tight in time. This project could take a long time to research and finish, especially on my own. 
  - Measures: The project succeed when the algorithm is properly coded, and be able to show professor the project using interactive visuals, 
	          not code lines. 
  - Motivation: Capstone and a potential reason for companies to hire me.
  - Future Extensions: Black hole. Although the blackhole does follow the rules of physics to an extend, 
	                   it is very special and hard to implement, let alone demonstrate. 


Add a relative link to concept.md from README.md to concept.md. (A relative link uses just the file name and not http://...) Test this link and make sure it works.
