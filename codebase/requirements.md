Number: 1
Statement: Must be object-oriented-programming
Evaluation Method: By looking through the code, with class and constructors used. 
Dependency: The patience of mine to work on a method that I need more work on.
Priority: Mid, because this is for my own requirement. The project would still run well using other method, but I should aim for a tidy and effective coding habit.

Number: 2
Statement: The mechanics of the algorithm must be hidden from the user. Using other illustrations to demonstrate the funtions instead.
Evaluation Method: If the code run and the user can interact with the algorithm without changing the code. 
Dependency: None
Priority: High. It is important to show that the algorithm is simple to understand. Following abstration principle will also show that the project is usable in real life situations. 

Number: 3
Statement: software can store the changes in each demonstrations. And for each new run, the user have a choice to run a new simulation, or continue old one. 
Evaluation Method: When each simulation can be stored in any file. Could be a picture file, or simply a note file to save progress. 
Dependency: None
Priority: Low. This requirement could become very important if I want to expand the algorithm, which will need more time for testing.
