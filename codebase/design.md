Class planet
- Include variables such as mass, size, position of the planets 
- constructor of planets
Method: 
Draw planets: 
- Use variables to draw planets.
- Variable use: size, color, position.
Orbit: 
- Method to rotate planets around the Sun, using REAL mass numbers.
- Variable use: planet position, mass 
* basically calculate attraction between planets to show how planets orbit around.
