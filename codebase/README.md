- Project name: Gravity
- **Project Concept (concept.md)**
[Scope]: The boundaries should be completing one working algorithm which is the gravity simulation. The algorithm will include 2 examples to demonstrate it. The mentioned goals should be completed about 3 weeks before demonstration day, to leave time for any interesting additions, if any. 
[Vision]: The main purpose of the project is to fulfill capstone. I believe that with my level, it is difficult for the project to be anything ground-breaking. But it still is a great oppotunity for me to learn. It is possible that this project can still be developed even after the class ended, and slowly become a complete simulation.
- Prerequisites: A working algorithm that make objects follow the law of physics. 
- Built With: Python
